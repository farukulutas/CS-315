# CS-315
All my work in CS 315 - Programming Languages course.

## Project 1 (CS315_Group3_Cardilan) 91/100
### A Programming Language for Sets and its Lexical Analyzer

This semester's projects are about the design of a new language for finite sets. This newly designed language will be similar to imperative languages with the main difference of only working with variables and expressions of mainly the set type.

## Project 2 (CS315s22_team3) 93/100
### Parser for a Programming Language for Sets

The second project builds on your language design of the first project. This project involves building a parser for your language using the yacc tool. Please refer to the description of Project 1 for the requirements for your programming language design.
